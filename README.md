# Cyber-Tools
-*almost abandoned, soon I will resume it for the preparation of the PEN-200 exam, adding the knowledge acquired in this journey*-
Very basic tools for Red & Blue Teams

To-do:
 - Upload new automatized scripts that exploit the most frequently observed vulnerabilities or attack vectors in the wild.
 - Make more basic tools for reverse connections, gathering data (photos, user input, stored cookies...), post explotation and pivoting
 - Add a folder with cheatsheet of various types of injections (XSS, PHP, SQL, AQL, NOSQL, URL injection)
 - Some samples of Session hijacking and Cookie manipulation
